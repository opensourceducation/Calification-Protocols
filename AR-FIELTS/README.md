AR-FIELTS is the first scoring protocol created to look for indications of proficiency in a specific area of knowledge by searching for evidence of:

- Frecuency
- Interval
- Evolution
- Lot of data references(amount)
- Time to resolve the problem
- Space betwen proofs

<br>

To calculate the experience in solving identical or similar problems using the data provided by the data screenshots.
Each measurement is accompanied by an ELO score similar to that of chess, and another score more similar to the traditional measurement system according to the country. For example, in mexico, it would handle a scoring system from 0 to 10 by tracing an inverse exponential curve in each evidence. Where passing 3 of the 6 tests indicates proficiency, and 4 expertise

<br>

AR (Amount upon Result) means that it is a protocol that weights experience, or amount of data over time, over test score. An AR grading protocol in the case of measuring skills in photo-scarce environments would better weight the result over the number of screenshots solving similar problems.
